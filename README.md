# GROQ of Thrones

## A tool to become GROQ Guru!

Inspired by [GraphQL of Thrones](https://github.com/swyx/FSA-graphql-of-thrones) by [Swyx](https://twitter.com/swyx) and my love with Sanity [GROQ](https://sanity-io.github.io/GROQ/) language.

I also want to create different learning experiences. Much inspired by [Magnus Holm](https://twitter.com/judofyr) [blog](https://css-tricks.com/query-json-documents-in-the-terminal-with-groq/) that use GROQ cli to learn GROQ.

Graph Relational Object Queries or GROQ is authored by [Alexander Staubo](https://twitter.com/purefiction) and [Simen Svale Skogsrud](https://twitter.com/svale). Additional follow up work by [Erik Grinaker](https://twitter.com/erikgrinaker) and [Magnus Holm](https://twitter.com/judofyr).
